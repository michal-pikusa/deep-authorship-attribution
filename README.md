# deepNeuralText

A multi-class text classification based on a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units. 

Features:
- The network includes an embedding layer, so the input is first transformed into padded sequences of fixed length. 
- PoS-tagging is also included to improve classification, but is not essential for the network to run.

Performance:
- 88.6% accuracy on an example corpus from Kaggle Spooky Author Identification challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification)

Version: 0.2
