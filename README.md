# deepNeuralText

A multi-class text classification based on a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units. The network includes an embedding layer, so the input is first transformed into padded sequences of fixed length. PoS-tagging is also included to improve classification, but is not essential for the network to run.
